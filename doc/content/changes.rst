---------------------

Installer:
  - Fixed running of the installer with Java 8.

Eclimd:
  - Starting eclimd in the background is now done using the ``-b`` flag instead
    of passing a ``start`` argument.

  - Fixed issue with large portions of code being re-formatted when applying a
    correction suggestion.
  - TODO/FIXME markers are now ignored by validation.

Python:
  - Eclim's python support been re-written to use pydev instead of rope.

    .. note::

      Any exiting eclim python projects you have should be re-created with the
      new ``python`` nature:

      ::

        :ProjectCreate /path/to/project -n python

Scala:
  - Disabled use of temp files which could cause some validation errors.
  - Added support for :ref:`automated imports <:ScalaImport>`.

    missing dtd for non-english users.

| :gitlog:`Git Log (2.3.3) <2.3.2...2.3.3>`

.. _2.3.2:
.. _1.7.18:

2.3.2 / 1.7.18 (Sep. 12, 2013)
------------------------------

Installer:
  - Fixed extraction of scala vim files when installing scala support.

Php:
  - Fixed completion of php namespaces.

| :gitlog:`Git Log (2.3.2) <2.3.1...2.3.2>`
| :gitlog:`Git Log (1.7.18) <1.7.17...1.7.18>`

.. _2.3.1:

2.3.1 (Jul. 27, 2013)
---------------------

Installer:
  - Fixed dependencies to point at the Kepler update site.

| :gitlog:`Git Log (2.3.1) <2.3.0...2.3.1>`

.. _2.3.0:
.. _1.7.17:

2.3.0 / 1.7.17 (Jul. 21, 2013)
------------------------------

Java:
  - :ref:`:NewJarEntry <:NewJarEntry_java>` now accepts up to 3 arguments
    allowing you to create the jar entry with the path to the jar, path to the
    source, and the path to the javadocs.
  - On javadoc search, all results, including results found in jar files, will
    be fully translated to usable urls to be opened by vim instead of sending
    jar results back to eclipse to let it open them. With this change your
    chosen brower on the vim side will always be used.
  - Fix for import grouping by package on Kepler.

Php:
  .. warning::

    **Reminder:** The format of the h2 database used for php searching and code
    completion has changed in **Kepler** which may result in searching / code
    completion not returning any results, both in eclim and in the standard
    eclipse php editor.  To fix this you'll need to stop eclipse, remove the old
    index, and then restart:

    ::

      $ rm -r <your workspace>/.metadata/.plugins/org.eclipse.dltk.core.index.sql.h2/

Scala:
  - Updated to require 3.0.1 of the Scala IDE which now supports Kepler (for
    eclim 2.3.0 only). Since this version of the Scala IDE seems to only support
    Scala 2.10.x now, the option to install 2.9.x version has been removed,
    however the indigo release of eclim (1.7.17) still supports the Scala 2.9.x
    version of Scala IDE 3.0.0.

Xml:
  - :ref:`:XmlFormat <:XmlFormat>` now uses the DOM3 APIs to improve the
    formatted result, honoring your ``textwidth`` and indent settings.

| :gitlog:`Git Log (2.3.0) <2.2.7...2.3.0>`
| :gitlog:`Git Log (1.7.17) <1.7.16...1.7.17>`

.. _2.2.7:
.. _1.7.16:

2.2.7 / 1.7.16 (Jul. 14, 2013)
------------------------------

Java:
  - Fix for some completions on Kepler.
  - Fix for rare case where an invalid classpath entry could result in the
    .classpath file reverted to the eclipse default.
  - :ref:`:JavaCallHierarchy <:JavaCallHierarchy>` added to show the caller or
    callee hierarchy of a method. Thanks to Alexandre Fonseca.

Php:
  .. warning::

    The format of the h2 database used for php searching and code completion has
    changed in **Kepler** which may result in searching / code completion not
    returning any results, both in eclim and in the standard eclipse php editor.
    To fix this you'll need to stop eclipse, remove the old index, and then
    restart:

    ::

      $ rm -r <your workspace>/.metadata/.plugins/org.eclipse.dltk.core.index.sql.h2/

Ruby:
  - Fixed the inserted completion text for some ruby libraries.

Scala:
  - The graphical installer now includes a compiled eclim sdt bundle for both
    scala 2.9.x and 2.10.x for which one will be chosen for you if you already
    have the scala-ide installed, otherwise you can pick one and the appropriate
    version of the scala-ide will be installed for you.

Vimplugin:
  - The option to force focusing of gvim with a simulated click is now disabled
    by default, but when enabled, it should be less likely to have unintended
    side affects.

Cygwin:
  - Performance optimization for user's with many projects.

Installer:
  - The installer will now properly shutdown eclimd instances registered using
    the old non-json format.

Docs:
  - Expanded the :doc:`developer docs </development/index>` to include docs on
    :doc:`creating new commands </development/commands>` along with some of the
    basics for :doc:`adding new eclim plugins </development/plugins>`.

2.2.6 / 1.7.14 (May 18, 2013)
------------------------------

Bug Fixes:
  - Fixed eclimd to prevent incorrect addition of -d32 on 64bit systems, which
    prevents eclimd from starting.
  - Fix potential conflicts between syntastic validation vs eclim validation
    (syntastic validation will be diabled if eclim validation is available for
    the current file type).
  - Many more fixes.

Android:
  - Updated for ADT 22.0.0

C/C++:
  - :ref:`:CCallHierarchy <:CCallHierarchy>` now support showing callee tree.

Java:
  - :ref:`:JavaImpl <:JavaImpl>` now supports anonymous inner classes and will
    also properly handle suggesting methods from a nested superclass.

Php:
  - Eclim will no longer run php files through html validation by default (see
    the :doc:`Php Validation </vim/php/validate>` doc for settings to enable
    html validation).

Scala:
  - Scala support updated for Scala IDE 3.0.0.
  - Scala now supported on both versions of eclim (Juno and Indigo).

------------------------------

Eclim:
  - Updated :ref:`:ProjectTree <:ProjectTree>` and :ref:`:ProjectTab
    <:ProjectTab>` to support an arbitrary directory as an argument, allowing
    you to use the command for project's not managed by eclipse/eclim. :TreeTab
    has been removed since the update to :ProjectTab makes it redundant.

| :gitlog:`Git Log (1.7.11) <1.7.10...1.7.11>`

.. _2.2.2:
.. _1.7.10:

2.2.2 / 1.7.10 (Oct. 07, 2012)
------------------------------

Eclimd:
  - Updated eclimd script for Linux/OSX to supply reasonable defaults for heap
    and perm gen space if not already set by ~/.eclimrc.

C/C++:
  - Fixed C++ project creation to auto add the required C nature.
  - Fixed C/C++ issues introduced by the eclipse 4.2.1 release (project
    create/refresh and call hierarchy).

Java:
  - :JavaImportSort, :JavaImportClean, and :JavaImportMissing all removed in
    favor of a new command which performs the functionality of all three:
    :ref:`:JavaImportOrganize <:JavaImportOrganize>`
  - The vim option g:EclimJavaImportExclude has been replaced with the eclim
    setting :ref:`org.eclim.java.import.exclude <org.eclim.java.import.exclude>`.
  - The vim option g:EclimJavaImportPackageSeparationLevel has been replaced
    with the eclim setting :ref:`org.eclim.java.import.package_separation_level
    <org.eclim.java.import.package_separation_level>`.
  - g:EclimJavaBeanInsertIndexed vim variable removed in favor of suffixing
    :JavaGetSet methods with '!'.
  - :JavaCorrect, :JavaImpl, :JavaDelegate, :JavaConstructor, and :JUnitImpl
    all now perform their code manipulations using eclipse operations.
  - Initial support added for running :JavaSearch commands from source file
    results (library source files) not in a project.
  - g:EclimJavaCheckstyleOnSave replaced with the eclim setting
    :ref:`org.eclim.java.checkstyle.onvalidate
    <org.eclim.java.checkstyle.onvalidate>`.
  - g:EclimJavaSrcValidate renamed to g:EclimJavaValidate.
  - :JUnitExecute replaced with a new and improved :ref:`:JUnit <:JUnit>`
    command.
  - Added the command :ref:`:JUnitFindTest <:JUnitFindTest>` to open the
    corresponding test for the current file.
  - Removed :Javac command since eclipse's continuous incremental builds
    typically make the :Javac call a no op, and in cases where you need to
    induce compilation, :ref:`:ProjectBuild <:ProjectBuild>` does so in a
    language agnostic way.
  - Added :ref:`:JavaMove <:JavaMove>` command to move a java source file from
    one package to another.
  - Added :ref:`:JavaDocPreview <:JavaDocPreview>` to display the javadoc of
    the element under the cursor in vim's preview window.
